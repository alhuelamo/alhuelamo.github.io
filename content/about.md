Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is `Alberto`. I'm a software engineer from [Barcelona](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Barcelona/@41.3926467,2.0701492,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12a49816718e30e5:0x44b0fb3d4f47660a!8m2!3d41.3873974!4d2.168568), where I work as a data engineer. I'm always curious and I try to learn from other fields, but here you will mostly find stuff related to Scala, data engineering, Python...

This is my website, where you can find my links to my social stuff â€” [github](https://github.com/alhuelamo), [twitter](https://twitter.com/alhuelamo), and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alhuelamo/). From time to time, I drop some thoughts on my [blog](/posts). I hope you find them insightful!
