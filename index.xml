I bought an M1 Mac Mini, and I have been using it as my main personal desktop â€” games aside â€” for the last months. I&amp;rsquo;m extreamly pleased with this machine: it&amp;rsquo;s small, it feels fast and snappy, it&amp;rsquo;s quiet â€” I have never ever heard the fans â€” and its power consumption is very low.
Apple&amp;rsquo;s plan is to carry out a 2-year transition from November 2020 to replace its Intel-based Macs by M-something ones.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://alhuelamo.com/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alhuelamo.com/about/</guid><description>Photo by Kaspars Upmanis in Unsplash
