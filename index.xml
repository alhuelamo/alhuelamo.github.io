In my company we have a considerably big Scala codebase. We use Scala for data pipelines, function apps, web services&amp;hellip; Everything is based on a common set of libraries that standardizes access to resources, enforces some conventions, and of course provides several utilities.

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alberto. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer from Barcelona, where I work as a data engineer. I&amp;rsquo;m always curious and I try to learn from other fields, but here you will mostly find stuff related to Scala, data engineering, Python&amp;hellip;
This is my website, where you can find my links to my social stuff â€” github, twitter, and linkedin. From time to time, I drop some thoughts on my blog.</description></item></channel></rss>
